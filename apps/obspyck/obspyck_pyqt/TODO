- rewrite popup info window in checkForSysopEventDuplicates()
- rewrite popup dialog window in on_qToolButton_deleteEvent_clicked()
- handling of special keys on linux?!?
- try on Windows/Mac (also with compiled external programs)


low priority:
- move all combobox initializations from the qt_designer to dynamic setup using (new) dicts in util.py (see setup of phase_type combobox in __init__)
- check if extending SEISMIC_PHASES works dynamically
- write all output to both console and textboxes in GUI (override sys.stdout/err with methods that write to stdout/err and textboxes)
- replace rpy in wadati plot by scipy routines
- remove most of the info messages?? they take lots of lines and are really not that interesting (initially partly for debugging)
- check if starttime_global and starttime_local work correctly, not really happy with the way it is
- check if we really ned all the axes remembering and manual deleting, somehow this was necessary at some point but I still think this could be done easier/simpler/clearer...
- write some doc, esp. on internal structure of data (all the dicts and stuff)
